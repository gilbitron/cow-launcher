# Cow Launcher

Flying cows, dynamite, trampolines... what more could you want in a game!

The aim is simple. Launch your cow as far you can.

## Notes

I made this game using [ImpactJS](http://impactjs.com/). It was then ported to an iOS game
and was available in the App Store for a while. The game is no longer available on the
App Store but I'm making it available as a desktop web game in the hope someone might
get some enjoyment out of it again.
